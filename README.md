# Overview
In this project, I conducted customer segmentation using bank transaction data. As part of data preprocessing, I ran data imputation, feature engineering, ordinal labeling, etc. Segmentation was done using K Means. 

# Dataset. 
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (transaction data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation/data) and Github (population data: https://github.com/siddharthjain1611/Top-500-Indian-cities/blob/master/cities_r2.csv). The transaction data comprises over a million records on 9 variables, and the population data was used to supplement the transaction data.

# Dependencies
